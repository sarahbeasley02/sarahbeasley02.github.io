## Bio

I am a 3rd year, PY1 PharmD student at MCPHS University who has recently obtained my Minor in Biostatistics from Simmons University. My research interests involve R&D for new and promising drugs with a focus on overall development and quality control, integrating my knowledge of RStudio and New England compounding laws/regulations towards a better future for healthcare. I am currently looking for internships that allow me to expand my knowledge of pharmacy through practice in different sub-fields to develop my critical thinking and leadership skills.
